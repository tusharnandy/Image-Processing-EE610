# README

## Installing the packages
If you are on linux, don't download anything. Use the environment in "env" by typing:
```
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```
Else, use requirements.txt to download the packages

## Storing the images
Although there are images to test in raw_images, images of your choice should be placed in the main folder for ease of access.

## Runing the code
After installing the packages, run
```
$ python/python3 main.py
```

## Saving the images
Images are stored in .jpg format by default. Do not add extension in filename before saving.
